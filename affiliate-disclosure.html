      <h2>💡 Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
      <p>Transparency You Can Trust</p>
    </div>

    <div class="last-updated">
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 18, 2026<br>
      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 18, 2026
    </div>

    <h1>Affiliate Disclosure Policy</h1>

    <p>
      At <strong>WoW Glam Decor</strong> (<a href="https://www.wowglamdecor.com" target="_blank">www.wowglamdecor.com</a>), 
      we believe in complete transparency with our readers. This page explains how we use affiliate marketing 
      and how it may affect you as a visitor to our website.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
    <p>
      Affiliate links are special URLs that contain a unique tracking code. When you click on an affiliate link 
      and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission from the retailer or brand at <strong>no additional cost to you</strong>. 
      The price you pay remains exactly the same whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the retailer's website.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> You never pay more when using our affiliate links. In fact, we often negotiate 
      exclusive discounts and deals for our readers!</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Why We Use Affiliate Marketing</h2>
    <p>
      Running a high-quality home decor blog requires significant time, effort, and resources. Affiliate marketing 
      allows us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep our content free for all readers</li>
      <li>Continue creating valuable home decor guides, reviews, and inspiration</li>
      <li>Invest in better photography, research, and content quality</li>
      <li>Cover website hosting, maintenance, and operational costs</li>
      <li>Dedicate time to testing products and providing honest reviews</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Our Affiliate Partnerships</h2>
    <p>
      WoW Glam Decor participates in several affiliate marketing programs. When you see product recommendations 
      on our site, some may include affiliate links. Here are the programs we work with:
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Amazon Associates Program</h3>
    <div class="example-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Official Disclosure:</strong> WoW Glam Decor is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, 
        an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising 
        and linking to Amazon.com, Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk, and other Amazon international sites.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>3.2 Other Affiliate Networks</h3>

    </div>

    <h3>3.3 Direct Brand Partnerships</h3>
    <p>
      We occasionally work directly with home decor brands and retailers who share our values of quality and 
      customer satisfaction. These partnerships may involve affiliate commissions, sponsored content, or 
      product gifting. All sponsored content is clearly labeled.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. How We Identify Affiliate Links</h2>
    <p>
      To maintain transparency, we identify affiliate content in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Article Disclaimers:</strong> Every article containing affiliate links includes a clear disclosure 
        at the top of the post</li>
      <li><strong>Visual Indicators:</strong> We use badges like "💡 Affiliate Link" or "Shop Now" buttons</li>
      <li><strong>Disclosure Banners:</strong> Prominent yellow banners alert you when content contains affiliate links</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example-box">
      <h4>Example Disclosure (as seen on our blog posts):</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>💡 Affiliate Disclosure:</strong> This post contains affiliate links. If you purchase through our links, 
        we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. We only recommend products we genuinely use and love. 
        Read our full disclosure policy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Our Editorial Integrity</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>We prioritize honesty over commissions.</strong> Here's our commitment to you:
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>Our Promises:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Honest Recommendations:</strong> We only recommend products we genuinely believe in, have personally 
          used, or have thoroughly researched</li>
        <li><strong>Unbiased Reviews:</strong> Our opinions are never influenced by affiliate commissions. We share both 
          pros and cons</li>
        <li><strong>No Misleading Claims:</strong> We never exaggerate product benefits or hide negative aspects to 
          increase sales</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative Options:</strong> We provide multiple product options, including non-affiliate alternatives 
          when appropriate</li>
        <li><strong>Real Testing:</strong> When possible, we personally test products before recommending them</li>
        <li><strong>Reader-First:</strong> Your trust and satisfaction are more valuable to us than any commission</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. FTC Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      WoW Glam Decor complies with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines concerning the use of endorsements 
      and testimonials in advertising. The FTC requires that we disclose any material connection between us and the 
      brands or products we recommend.
    </p>

    <div class="important-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Key FTC Requirement:</strong> When there is an affiliate relationship or any compensation involved, 
        we must clearly and conspicuously disclose this to our readers. This disclosure must be placed where readers 
        are likely to see it before clicking on affiliate links.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      We take these regulations seriously and ensure all affiliate relationships are clearly disclosed in compliance 
      with FTC 16 CFR Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. How Cookies Work with Affiliate Links</h2>
    <p>
      When you click on an affiliate link, a small piece of data called a "cookie" is stored in your browser. 
      This cookie helps the retailer track that you came from our website. Here's what you should know:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cookie Duration:</strong> Cookies typically last 24 hours to 90 days depending on the affiliate program</li>
      <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> Affiliate cookies do not collect personally identifiable information</li>
      <li><strong>Commission Tracking:</strong> They only track that a purchase was made after clicking our link</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> The retailer does not share your purchase details with us</li>
      <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can clear cookies from your browser at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>8. Sponsored Content vs. Affiliate Links</h2>
    <p>
      It's important to understand the difference:
    </p>

    <h3>8.1 Affiliate Links</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We receive a commission only if you make a purchase</li>
      <li>We independently choose which products to feature</li>
      <li>No payment received for writing the content</li>
      <li>Editorial control remains 100% with us</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.2 Sponsored Content (if applicable)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We receive payment for creating content about a specific product or brand</li>
      <li>Clearly labeled as "Sponsored," "Paid Partnership," or "Ad"</li>
      <li>We only accept sponsorships for products we genuinely recommend</li>
      <li>We maintain editorial independence and honest opinions</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>9. Product Gifting Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      Occasionally, brands may send us products for free in hopes that we will review them. Here's our policy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are never obligated to write about gifted products</li>
      <li>Receiving a free product does not guarantee a positive review</li>
      <li>We clearly disclose when a product was gifted</li>
      <li>Our opinions remain honest and unbiased</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>10. Price Accuracy and Availability</h2>
    <div class="important-box">
      <p>
        <strong>Please Note:</strong> Prices and availability of products mentioned on our site are subject to change. 
        The prices displayed on our site were accurate at the time of posting but may have changed. Please verify 
        current pricing on the retailer's website before making a purchase.
